---------PLEASE READ IT BEFORE GOING TO THE SITE --------

This is not a dangerous site – YOU CAN PROCEED FURTHER
Google chrome or any other web browser may show you the page as shown in the picture below, but this is not a dangerous site – I have hosted it using 000webhost – it has not provided SSL security that’s why its showing like this. 
You can go to MORE DETAILS -> VISIT THE UNSAFE SITE
 
1.	Sign up before using the website
 

2.	After sign up login window will appear -> login 
3.	Then you will see list of all movies (added by you to the database and by the other users)
 
4.	Private means movies added by you and only you can see them 
5.	Publicly available means movies that every user can see
6.	Go to My List in the side bar
 
7.	Here you will see all the movies added by you 
8.	You can make then public or you can make them private to you only (if already public)
9.	Go to Public list -> here you will see all the movies that are public to everyone 
 
10.	 You can’t modify the public list. You can only modify your movies by going to my list tab in the side bar
11.	Then go to add movies -> you can add your movies here 
 
12.	Provide all the details and if that movie is not already registered to the database then it will be registered by your name 
13.	Sign out
NEXT STEPS
1.	Now you can add different users and check which movies are visible to them and which are not visible.
2.	You can also test the website by adding same type of movies (it will not add)
3.	Private movie list will remain private to that user only who created it.
Database Schema
I haven’t used the online API -> created my own database of 5-6 movies 
Therefore there was no need to implement a search bar (can be easily implemented though) -> just you need to pass the value searched by the user to the sql command and it will searh….
1.	Only used 2 tables
2.	First table to store the user account information (see the images below)
3.	Second table to store movies -> public and private both
